# keylogger
This project demonstrates how a keylogger works by using two main files: a "client" and a "server".

keylogger.py (The Client): This is the program you run on a computer to capture keystrokes. It encrypts everything you type so it can't be easily read.

server.py (The Server): This program acts like a "home base" for the attacker. It waits to receive the encrypted data from the keylogger, then immediately decrypts it and shows the original typed text.

The goal is to show the complete process: capturing data, sending it securely, and then reading it. For this to work, both programs use a secret encryption.key file.

Usage:

Step 1: Start the keylogger.py.

```python3 keylogger.py```

Step 2: Start server.py and ensure it has the encrption.key that is generated by keylogger for encryptiona and decryption purpose.

```python3 server.py```
